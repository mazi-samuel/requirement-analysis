Requirement Analysis in Software Development. This repository explores SDLC contexts
🧩 What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and understanding the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It involves defining what the system should do — not how it will do it. This phase lays the foundation for every other stage in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

🔍 Detailed Explanation

During requirement analysis, software engineers, project managers, and clients collaborate to clearly define:

Functional requirements: The specific features and behaviors the system must have (e.g., user login, payment processing, data storage).

Non-functional requirements: The system’s performance characteristics such as security, scalability, usability, and reliability.

Constraints: Limitations related to technology, budget, or timelines.

This phase often includes activities like stakeholder interviews, document analysis, use case modeling, and the creation of Software Requirement Specifications (SRS).

🚀 Importance in the SDLC

Requirement Analysis is critical because it serves as the blueprint for the entire project. Getting this phase right ensures that the team builds the right product — one that meets user expectations and business goals.

Here’s why it’s so important:

Clarity and Understanding:
It ensures developers, designers, and stakeholders share a common understanding of what is being built.

Prevents Scope Creep:
Clearly defined requirements help prevent unnecessary changes or additions during development.

Improves Project Planning:
Accurate requirements allow for realistic timeframes, budgeting, and resource allocation.

Enhances Quality:
A system designed based on well-analyzed requirements is more likely to meet user needs and perform reliably.

Reduces Cost and Rework:
Detecting issues or misunderstandings early in the requirements phase saves time and money that would otherwise be spent fixing problems later.

🧠 In Summary

Requirement Analysis is the first and most essential step in building successful software. It bridges the gap between user needs and technical implementation, ensuring that every design and line of code contributes meaningfully toward solving the intended problem.
